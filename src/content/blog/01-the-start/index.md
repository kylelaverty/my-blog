Welcome to my blog! I had been trying to decide for a long time what to do in a space like this and have decided to just go for it.

### What to Expect

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

- Software Development
- Leadership
- Personal Development
- Video Games
- Gardening
- Baking

### What is this made out of?

This blog is built with Astro, a static site generator that uses React and built using GitHub Actions. It then uses GitHub Pages to host the site and my custom URL to front it.
