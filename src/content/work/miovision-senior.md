As a Senior Software Developer, I was instrumental in developing and monitoring AWS-based cloud applications at Miovision, leading agile retrospectives, and mentoring new team members. My role involved ensuring high standards of code quality, designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, and addressing technical gaps in upcoming projects.

- **Cloud Application Development:** Designed, developed, and monitored cloud-based applications using AWS services like EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch, and Step Functions.
- **On-Prem Application Development:** Designed, developed, and monitored on-prem applications using technologies and services like C#, AWS Systems Manager Agent and Datadog.
- **Team Leadership & Mentorship:** Led agile retrospectives, mentored new employees, and played a critical role in the hiring process of more than 10 employees, including full-time and co-op positions.
- **Quality Assurance & Problem Solving:** Ensured code quality through code reviews and coverage analysis and resolved technical issues by performing root-cause analysis. Brought code coverage from 50% to 75% in 12 months.
