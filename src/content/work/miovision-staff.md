At Miovision, I was responsible for defining the product's technical vision, architecting robust AWS-based solutions, and ensuring the team's high technical standards through code reviews, coaching and training. My role also included advocating for ongoing product improvements with senior leadership and aligning team standards with company-wide development standards.

- **Technical Vision & Architecture:** Led the establishment of the product's technical vision enabling previously thought impossible cloud technology integration with legacy infrastructure.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Proactively prioritized technical debt via negotiation with the product owner and senior leadership to ensure our solution's uptime increased from 99% to 99.9%.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Interfaced with other Technical Leads across the organization to establish development standards and assist with establishing the DevOps team.
- **Development & Monitoring:** Designed, developed and monitored new cloud-based solutions using C#, AWS, Terraform, and Datadog, resulting in a 10% reduction in infrastructure costs from initial estimates.
