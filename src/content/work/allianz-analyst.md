As a Business Analyst at Allianz Global Assistance, I focused on the design and creation of reporting environments and reports, as well as migrating legacy systems to modern platforms. I also worked on creating many new reports and analyzing existing report output.

- **Legacy System Reporting:** Developed and maintained reporting solutions on IBM AS400/iSeries systems and managed their migration to MS Reporting Services.
- **MS Reporting Services:** Designed and implemented reporting environments and reports using MS Reporting Services, SQL, and stored procedures.
- **Data Analysis & Insights:** Performed in-depth data analysis on AS400/iSeries systems and communicated findings to key stakeholders, including senior leadership.
